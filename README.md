# hello-world
A project for our CMPINF 0010 class. 

`something` takes a name and a number as inputs, compares the length of the name and the value number, and determines which is larger (the length of the name or the value of the number).

Created by Aidan Russell, Jackson McKay, and Brendan Lill.
